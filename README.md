# NLP Dementia
CONTENT-BASED NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING MODEL FOR DETERMINING THE TAXONOMY OF A DEMENTIA DEFINITION OF DEMENTIA MANAGED BY MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS IN ECUADOR IN ECUADOR

# Study problem
In several diseases and pathologies, the scientific community has not explicitly determined a definition that allows an accurate diagnosis, as is the case of dementias. Generically, there is a divergence of criteria at the time of diagnosis of dementia, anchored to its ambiguous definitions. The risk factors associated with dementia can be managed and reduced depending on the approach models that are implemented. In this sense, it is important to analyze the stories linked to dementia, because behind them can be evidenced the conceptual structure that prevails in the professionals who attend these processes.

# Project description
This website determines the taxonomy of a dementia definition by means of a natural language processing model, which takes as input a definition through manual typing or document upload in .csv format. The model makes use of two similarity metrics: Jaccard and Cosine, to present, through percentages, the level of membership of a dementia definition towards the three approaches proposed in the taxonomy. The page also presents the taxonomy of each of the definitions of the original Dataset that served as the basis for the design and programming of the proposed model.
